# jumper

Jumper is a game in which the player seeks to solve a puzzle by guessing the letters of a secret word one at a time.
For each wrong letter guess a whole will be created in the jumper's parachute.
After five wrong guesses the jumper will not be able to survice his jump and you will lose the game. 
If you are able to successfully guess every letter of the game and complete the secret word, the jumper will land safely, and you will win the game.
